## Getting Started:

### Providing you own OpenAI API Key  

 ( See [Create an API key in the dashboard here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart#create-and-export-an-api-key) :key: )

1) Create an `.env` file containing your OpenAI API Key:
   - Replace `<your_api_key>` with your key.

      ```.env
      OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
      ```

      **!** ***Do not*** wrap the key with quotation marks.

> [!TIP]
> In order to ensure the validity of your OpenAI API Key, run the [openai_request.py](openai_request.py).
>
>  If you're getting an explanation for the differences between apples and oranges, Congrats!  Your key is valid :tada:
